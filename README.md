# RIV-Fleet-C-Hotkeys
This Repo is intended to store source code of all Text Expansions, Snippets and Hotkeys that can improve and automate time consuming tasks at the SSOC. 

<h1> How to begin using PM list </h1>

To use this automation there are a few things that need to be checked and considered in order to make sure that the script does not break or cause unintended actions.

 1. This script or set of scripts currently is not full involved so you will need Text Expander to ensure that the Item and Price inputs for the Tire Rotation
    and Courtesy Check fil in correctly.
    1. More specifically, you need to make sure you have access to the snippet that allows for autofill of those particular items. See Ace if you need help obtaining this
 2. You will need to make sure you do not currently have any other shortcuts or text expansions/snippets binded to (ALT + BACKSPACE) or (WIN + Z)
 3. Once you have impersonated the intended Service Center, you will need to 'Return to Own Account' and search up the Repair Order again.
    1. The reason for this is because Auto Integrate for some arbitrary reason, does not allow for Enter keys to register so this will break the script and not
       allow for full completion of the automation.
